# Swifty Markdown

SwiftyMarkdown is a Swift-based *Markdown* parser that converts *Markdown* files or strings into **NSAttributedStrings**. It uses sensible defaults and supports dynamic type, even if you use custom fonts.

## Features

Customise fonts and colours easily in a Swift like way: 

`md.h1.fontName = "AvenirNextCondensed-Medium"`

*An italic line*

It ignores random * and correctly handles \*escaped\* asterisks.
